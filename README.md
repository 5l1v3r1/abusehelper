# AbuseHelper [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/abusesa/abusehelper.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/abusesa/abusehelper)

AbuseHelper is an open-source framework for receiving and redistributing abuse feeds and threat intel.

## Running tests & linter

We have enabled automated tests (for Python 2.6, 2.7 and PyPy) and flake8 linting. The build logs are viewable at https://circleci.com/gh/abusesa/abusehelper.

To run the tests locally you need to have [```tox```](http://tox.testrun.org/) installed (for example via ```pip install tox```). Then, while in the project directory, run:

```
$ tox
```
